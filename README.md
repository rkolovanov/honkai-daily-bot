In development. Now clicker app can:
- Start game;
- Wait for login in;
- Accomplish some challenges (now gold sepal only - char. exp, weap. exp and credits);
- Exit game (Alt-F4).

Challenged to do is set in `__main__.py` file.

Maybe this clicker won't work on your screen resolution. I'm using 3440x1440.
