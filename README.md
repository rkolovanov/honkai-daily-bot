# honkai-daily-bot

In development. Now clicker app can:
- Start game;
- Wait for login in;
- Accomplish some challenges and collect rewards;
- Exit game (kill it).

Challenged to do is set in `honkai-clicker/__main__.py` file.

Maybe this clicker won't work on your screen resolution or language. I'm using 3440x1440 and Russian language. 
If the clicker does not work at your resolution, or you have a language other than Russian in the game, then you need to roughly reshoot the screenshots of the buttons in the `honkai-clicker/images/<your_resolution>` folder.
